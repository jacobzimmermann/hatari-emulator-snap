name: hatari-emulator
version: '2.1.0'
summary: Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator
description: |
  Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including
  some special tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample
  sound. A joystick can be emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC
  joystick. Hatari also features the possibility to "mount" a directory of the
  host system as a ST drive, or to use images from an original Atari's hard
  disk.

  Hatari is also able to emulate the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon
  machines, like the Videl video chip or the DSP 56001. However, note that TT
  and Falcon support are currently still in development and experimental.
